        <h2 class="header">Under-5 mortality rate for all countires with data, 1950 - 2015.</h2>
        <p class="header">Globally and regionally, under-5 mortality is decreasing. However, globally we have yet to reach the Millenium Development Goals (MDG) in child mortality. Sub-Saharan Africa has had the most rapid rate of reduction, although it stil remains the region with the highest under-5 mortality rate in the world.</p>
        <p class="header">The MDG target for under-5 mortality is as follows: <em>"reduce child mortality (globally) by two-thirds, from 87 children of every 1,000 dying before age 5 in 1990 to 29 of every 1,000 in 2015"</em> (<a href="http://www.unicef.org/mdg/index_childmortality.htm">UNICEF</a>). This target number (29) is shown on the chart below. According to the most recent UNICEF report, the global under-5 mortality rate stands at 43, above the goal for 2015.</p>
